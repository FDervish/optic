# Description
This project is an effort to bring medals to Halo Custom Edition that are compatible with Chimera
1.0, but at the same time looking for a better and more flexible way to customize your own medals,
this repository aims to be the standard for medals released under the Mercury repository, but feel
free to contribute by pull requests or discussing on the
[Shadowmods Discord Server](https://discord.shadowmods.net).
