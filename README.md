# Description
This project is an effort to bring medals to Halo Custom Edition that are compatible with Chimera
1.0, but at the same time looking for a better and more flexible way to customize your own medals,
this repository aims to be the standard for medals released under the Mercury repository, but feel
free to contribute by pull requests or discussing on the
[Shadowmods Discord Server](https://discord.shadowmods.net).

# Supported Medals
Right now the project is aiming to provide an acceptable quantity of medals from Halo 4 as an
standard for medals available to recreate on Halo Custom Edition.

- Kill
- Double Kill
- Triple Kill
- Killtacular
- Killing Spree
- Running Riot
- Snapshot (Beta)
- Rocket Kill
- Needler Kill
- Close Call

Also this project provides simple hitmaker support.

New medals will be added across time, be sure to follow us on our Discord server for every upcoming
release with new features, fixes and medals.
